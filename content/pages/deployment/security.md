# Default Password
Make sure you edit the default username and password in your `config.js` file.  
```
##### WARNING #####
// You MUST change the username and password for security
// Do NOT use "admin" as a username as it's easily guessed.
// You are encouraged to use tools to generate a password
// Preferably, use a local password manager
// If you absolutely must use an online tool, here are some suggestions
